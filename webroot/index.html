            <p>
                NexOS is a revolutionary operating system designed from the ground up with 
                simplicity, performance, and AI integration as core principles. The system 
                incorporates AI capabilities to continuously monitor, analyze, and improve 
                its own codebase during runtime.

                NexOS is built around a minimalist microkernel architecture that provides only 
                the most essential services. The system is designed to be modular, with each 
                component optimized for its specific task.

            <h2>Self-Evolution Mechanism</h2>
            <p>
                The self-evolution process follows these steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Continuous collection of performance metrics, error logs, and resource usage</li>
                <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> AI engine analyzes collected data to identify inefficiencies or bugs</li>
                <li><strong>Solution Generation:</strong> AI generates optimized code patches for identified issues</li>
                <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Security module verifies that generated patches meet safety criteria</li>
                <li><strong>Application:</strong> Safe application of patches with rollback capability</li>
                <li><strong>Learning:</strong> System learns from the results of applied changes</li>

                NexOS includes a high-performance HTTP server built on its architecture. 
                The web server leverages NexOS's efficient I/O subsystem and self-evolution 
                capabilities to continuously optimize its performance.
