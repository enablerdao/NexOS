# NexOS Demo

This demo showcases the core concepts of NexOS, a next-generation self-evolving operating system.

## Running the Demo

To run the demo, follow these steps:

1. Compile the demo program:
   ```
   gcc demo.c -o bin/nexos_demo
   ```

2. Run the demo:
   ```
   ./bin/nexos_demo
   ```

## What the Demo Shows

The demo demonstrates the following key features of NexOS:

1. **System Initialization**: Initializes the kernel, memory subsystem, scheduler, I/O subsystem, security subsystem, and AI engine.

2. **Process Creation**: Creates a test process with an associated thread.

3. **Self-Evolution System**: Initializes and enables the self-evolution system.

4. **Performance Monitoring**: Collects performance metrics from various subsystems.

5. **AI Analysis**: Analyzes performance metrics to identify optimization opportunities.

6. **Patch Generation**: Generates optimization patches based on the analysis.

7. **System Analysis**: Performs a system-wide analysis for potential optimizations.

## Understanding the Output

The demo output shows the sequence of operations performed by NexOS:

1. Kernel initialization
2. Security subsystem initialization
3. AI engine initialization
4. Self-evolution system initialization
5. Process and thread creation
6. Self-evolution enablement
7. Performance metrics collection
8. Performance analysis
9. Patch generation
10. System analysis
11. Cleanup

This demonstrates the complete lifecycle of the self-evolution process, from monitoring to analysis to optimization.

## Next Steps

In a full implementation of NexOS, the generated patches would be:

1. Verified for safety by the security subsystem
2. Applied to the running system
3. Monitored for effectiveness
4. Rolled back if they cause problems

The system would continuously learn from the results of applied optimizations to improve future optimization decisions.
